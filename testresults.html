											<h3>Harris Memon</h3>

										<p>My results for the online Myers Briggs test showed that I was of a mediator personality type. Mediator Personalities are guided by their principles rather than logic, mediators are led by the purity in their intent and not rewards or punishment. An online learning styles test results showed that I was a combination of the 3 learning styles but leaning towards being a Visual learner. Visual learners learn by seeing pictures or reading books and understand and remember things by sight and can picture things that they are learning in their head.</p>

											<h3>Tyson Hay</h3>

										<p>My results for the Myers-Briggs test showed that I have “The Debater” personality type. Debaters are quick thinkers, knowledgeable and charismatic, but also can be argumentative, intolerant and can find it difficult to focus. The strengths shown do help with group work as charisma can help in communication, but the weaknesses may cause a few problems for myself mainly, although these can be avoided. The results of an online learning test revealed that I am a visual learner. Visual learners find it easier to learn through images and physically reading/scanning through information, rather than having the information spoken to them. I believe this is helpful in an assignment like this as visual stimulus is used in the research for the topics given, therefore appealing to the visual learning style.</p>

											<h3>Callum Field</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My results for the tests show that I am an extrovert and an auditory learner. The Myers Briggs test shows that I am a campaigner, campaigners are independent, energetic, and compassionate. Although it says that campaigners are independent they are also intuitive and I believe this will come in handy during teamwork. This will assist me when working in a team as I will be able to take charge, communicating with the other members to make sure we’re on track and able to complete it in the time allocated.</p>
